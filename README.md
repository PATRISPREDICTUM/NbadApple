Bad Apple, Bad Quality, Bad Code for the TI-Nspire

This is my first TI project and it's not really good but funny (i think).

HOW TO USE

you'll need to install ndless first which can be found here:
http://ndless.me/

After you have successfully installed ndless onto your Calculator just drag the Player.tns and frames.tns into the same directory on your Ti-nspire.

To launch it you have to open the Player.tns and wait until it's loaded.

Once the Screen turns Black you can start the video by pressing enter once.

Controls:
ENTER - start/pause
+/-   - Jump one frame forward/backward
ESC   - Exit the Simulation
