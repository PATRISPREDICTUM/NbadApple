# NbadApple
Bad Apple, Bad Quality, Bad Code for the TI-Nspire

This is my first TI project and it's not really good but funny (i think).

HOW TO USE
CAUTION!!!
sometimes the Calculator crashes when exiting the Program...
Only tested with OS 4.4 but it should work fine on any CX Calc.


you'll need to install ndless first which can be found here:
http://ndless.me/

After you have successfully installed ndless onto your Calculator just drag the Player.tns and frames.tns into the same directory on your Ti-nspire.
To launch it you have to open the Player.tns and wait until it's loaded.
Once the Screen turns Black you can start the video by pressing enter once.

Controls:
ENTER - start/pause

+/-   - Jump one frame forward/backward

ESC   - Exit the Simulation
